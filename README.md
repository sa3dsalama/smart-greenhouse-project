# Smart Greenhouse Project

This project demonstrates a **Smart Greenhouse Automation System** that uses **IoT** technologies to automate various processes within a greenhouse, such as climate control, irrigation, and monitoring.

## Features

- **Climate Control**: Automatically optimizes temperature and humidity for better crop yields.
- **Efficient Irrigation**: Saves water resources while boosting plant health.
- **Solar Powered**: Uses clean energy for sustainability.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitor your greenhouse’s performance remotely using a mobile app.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**, **CSS** for front-end design.
- **JavaScript** for future interactivity and integration.
- **ESP32**, **Soil Moisture Sensor**, **Water Pump Motor**, and other IoT devices for automation.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
